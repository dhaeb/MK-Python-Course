ROT13 is a weak form of encryption that involves \"rotating\" each letter in a word by 13 places. To rotate a letter means to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning if necessary, so `a` shifted by 3 is `d` and `a` shifted by 1 is `z`. Define a string called `rotate_word` and an integer variable called `amount`. Now write a Python script that contains the letters from the `rotate_word`, but \"rotated\" by the given `amount`. Check your code using the following examples: 'cheer' rotated by 7 is 'jolly' and 'melon' rotated by -10 is 'cubed'. Use a list of alphabetical characters (['a', 'b', ..., 'z']). Hint: you can retrieve the index of an item in a list using the `index()` function."

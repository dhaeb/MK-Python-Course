      "- \"99 Bottles of Beer\" is a traditional song in the United States and Canada. It is popular to sing on long trips, as it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize, and can take a long time to sing. The song's simple lyrics are as follows: \"99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.\" The same verse is repeated, each time with one fewer bottle. The song is completed when the singer or singers reach zero. Your task here is write a Python code block capable of generating all the verses of the song. Use a `counter` integer variable and a `while` loop. Make sure that your loop will come to an end and that the inflection of the word bottle is adapted to the counter!\n"

      "- The third person singular verb form in English is distinguished by the suffix -s, which is added to the stem of the infinitive form: run -> runs. A simple set of rules can be given as follows: \"If the verb ends in y, remove it and add ies. If the verb ends in o, ch, s, sh, x or z, add es. By default just add s.\" Your task in this exercise is to write a code block which given a verb in infinitive form, prints its third person singular form. Test your function with words like \"try\", \"brush\", \"run\" and \"fix\". Can you think of verbs for which your code doesn't work? Check out the string method `.endswith()` online!\n"
